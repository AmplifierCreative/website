    We’re editors, copywriters, designers, illustrators, art directors, creative
    directors, project managers, brand strategists, SEO gurus, social media
    experts… And, yeah. There’s only two of us.

    You may know us from our zine days—and if so, we’re so glad you’ve found
    your way back to us. Thanks to people like you, who supported us endlessly
    through five gracious years, we were able to start our careers doing what we
    love to do.

        Since then, we’ve worked diligently at creative agencies, magazines, and
        brands—all while freelancing into the night. Why? Because we’re
        passionate about the work we do and driven to achieve something even
        greater. And, now—we found it.

        What once was a completely volunteer-run magazine is now a creative
        agency operated by a copy + design duo with the same vision in mind as
        our small magazine: to support and uplift businesses, entrepreneurs, and
        creative endeavors that are deserving of success and recognition.

        Since the beginning of our careers, we’ve been the workhorses—not the
        show ponies. The ones who pick up the slack, put the pieces back
        together, ground creative in strategy, and stick up for the work we
        believe in no matter what it takes.

        Now, it’s our turn to call the shots—and do it in a more meaningful way
        than before
