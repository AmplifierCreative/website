    We’re editors, copywriters, designers, illustrators, art directors,
    creative directors, project managers, brand strategists, SEO gurus, social
    media experts… And, yeah. There’s only two of us.

    You may know us from our zine days—and if so, we’re so glad you’ve found
    your way back to us. Thanks to people like you, who supported us endlessly
    through five gracious years, we were able to start our careers doing what we
    love to do.

    Since then, we’ve worked diligently at creative agencies, magazines, and
    brands—all while freelancing into the night. Why? Because we’re passionate
    about the work we do and driven to achieve something even greater. And,
    now—we found it.

    What once was a completely volunteer-run magazine is now a creative agency
    operated by a copy + design duo with the same vision in mind as our small
    magazine: to support and uplift businesses, entrepreneurs, and creative
    endeavors that are deserving of success and recognition.

    Since the beginning of our careers, we’ve been the workhorses—not the show
    ponies. The ones who pick up the slack, put the pieces back together, ground
    creative in strategy, and stick up for the work we believe in no matter what
    it takes.

    Now, it’s our turn to call the shots—and do it in a more meaningful way than
    before
