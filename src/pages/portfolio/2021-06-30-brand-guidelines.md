title: Brand guidelines
description: "In 2020, AudPop—a premium video entertainment platform—had many
  changes including a new rebrand and website. So naturally, an updated set of
  brand guidelines came next. AudPop reached out to us to help finetune the
  guidelines they already created, in addition to writing dos-and-don’ts social
  and email examples in their new brand voice and tone. "

whatWeDid: "AudPop’s brand guidelines had a lot of potential outside of the
  original request—so, we aligned on creating more thorough brand voice and tone
  pointers, messaging dos and don'ts, brand style guidelines, social examples
  (Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram, and Twitter), as well as email subject line
  and body copy examples. "
result: AudPop’s final brand guidelines now provide a thorough deep-dive into
  the brand, to set team members up for success when crafting design elements
  and written communications.

  - quote: '"As soon as Jen started talking, I knew she was the perfect person for
      our copywriting needs. The way she approaches copywriting is the perfect
      blend of strategy and creativity. Specifically for the brand guidelines, I
      was struggling to find the clear words to explain our brand voice and
      tone. Jen found the perfect words, and did a beautiful job making them
      come to life, representing AudPop perfectly. I look forward to working
      with Jen on projects for AudPop again and again!" '
