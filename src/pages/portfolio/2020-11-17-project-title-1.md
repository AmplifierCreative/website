title: Website launch
description: "After their recent rebrand, AudPop—a premium video entertainment
  platform—saw the need to have their website match in both design and
  functionality. With a team of marketers, executives, and web designers on
  their side, AudPop identified the need to incorporate a copywriter on their
  small team to make their new brand tone and voice shine as bright as the new
  website. "

whatWeDid: "When we partnered with AudPop, the core website pages were already
  laid out but several elements were left to be determined. So not only did we
  write landing page copy in their new voice and tone, we were also able to make
  strategic recommendations for the number of pages to ensure a seamless user
  experience, the flow of individual pages, strategically written and placed
  CTAs, and SEO optimization. "
result: "A seamless user experience across all main pages, with a strategic
  sitemap in place, that remains inclusive of AudPop’s globally diverse
  audience. "
