result: "High Brew Coffee benefitted from a quicker uptick in sales than other
  podcast advertisements. "
whatWeDid: With extensive research into the High Brew Coffee brand, we first
  pinpointed the best differentiators to reference in the advertisement. Then,
  we brainstormed ways to make this particular advertisement stand out among the
  rest in a way that highlighted the podcast’s voice and tone. So, what did we
  do? We wrote a skit.
testimonials:
  - quote: “Jen is an ad generating genius! As soon as I came to her to help create
      a fun and fitting ad for a client for the show, she immediately jumped to
      the task. She is so wonderful to work with, she communicated with me
      throughout the whole process, and ended up creating a fun skit that
      effectively grabbed listeners attention which resulted in sales for the
      client.”
