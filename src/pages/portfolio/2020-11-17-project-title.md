whatWeDid: "We started with a discovery call to gain more insights into the
  brand, mostly focusing on the team’s likes and dislikes as many branding
  details were still to be determined. (But, that meant added flexibility for us
  to explore fonts, colors, and design treatments!) Next, we created and
  pressure-tested wordmarks and logos that incorporated their needs and
  must-haves in a way that not only represented the brand but made their new
  business stand out in a unique way. "
